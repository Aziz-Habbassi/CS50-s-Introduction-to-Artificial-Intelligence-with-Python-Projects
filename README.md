## About

This repository documents my hands-on work from the Harvard course **CS50: Introduction to AI with Python**. The projects cover core AI topics including search algorithms, knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning, and basic machine learning. The goal is to demonstrate clear, well-documented implementations that are easy to run and learn from.
